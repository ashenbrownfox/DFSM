### Simulating a Determinisitic Finite State Machine

The state.txt file is used for loading a state into the finite state machine.

Here is the general pattern how it should be formatted.
key:
number of states
number of alphabets
number of accepting states
number of transitions
Start State
List of States
List of the Alphabet
List of Accepting States
Transitions


The input.txt is used to test specific input strings. Just list each string sperated with a line break.

### instructions
Go to bin/Debug and run the .exe file to run the program. Follow on screen instructions.
